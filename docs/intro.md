# Welcome

Hi there, here I write about things I have learned on how to increase the security of my development workflow and how I interact with my servers. To be able to replicate it myself again later, if I need to, I decided to document what I found and wanted to share it with everybody, who may also be interested in the topic.

:::note
I am not an IT security expert. I am a Junior Developer with an interest in Security and Data Privacy.

While I try my best to include factually correct and up-to-date information, these guides should be considered work-in-progress and a documentation of what worked for me and may contain incorrect or out-of-date information. If you notice any information, that you think is incorrect or you think should be updated, please do not hesitate to open an issue on GitHub.

If you at any point run into issues while trying to follow a guide, but you are not sure, why something is not working, feel free to open a discussion on GitHub and maybe I can help you.
