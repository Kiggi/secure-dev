# Secure Development Guides

A collection of guides on how to be more secure, while developing, maintaining and operating applications and servers. This is my personal knowledge base, which I decided to share with everybody, who may also have an interest in securing their stuff and the stuff they build.

These guides are built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
